    deaR stakeHoldeRs, as the world gradually emerges from the unprecedented
    crisis brought about by covId-19 pandemic, IoI is mindful that we should
    continue to keep our focus on the longer-term challenge of climate change
    and the need to make the right choices for a sustainable and prosperous
    future. nevertheless however, at this key moment, it is important for us to

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">
  Group Managing Director and Chief Executive
  <p>
    Understanding that the safety of all of us is paramount, IOI has taken firm
    steps to minimise our risk of exposure to the coronavirus by ensuring all
    guidelines and information are conveyed in all the languages of our workers,
    that Standard Operating Procedure ("SOP") on quarantine, personal hygiene
    and medical assistance are in place, and all preventive measures are
    implemented. We have started an initiative to make our own masks that meet
    the N95 mask requirements so that we do not compete with our nation's
    front-liners for the availability of masks for their protection against the
    COVID-19 virus during their line of duty. I am proud to say that, as a
    company, we continue to face this adversity with resilience, flexibility and
    high team spirit.
  </p>
  <p>
    The embodiment of these characteristic core values is reflected in our
    current theme "Poised to expand our Green Footprint". The theme illustrates
    IOI's sustainability journey as we transition to a low carbon future. We
    have identified specific directions and targets to address issues such as
    high carbon stock conservation, peat management, waste management, energy ef
    ciency and by-product utilisation. The vision of a low carbon future within
    the larger context of climate change is addressed in IOI's
    <ref type="bibr">Five-Year Strategic Plan (2020</ref>
    <ref type="bibr">-2024</ref>
    and is aligned with the six UN SDGs 2, 8, 12, 13, 15 and 17 which we have
    adopted since 2017. I shall highlight the strategic initiatives in the
    Five-Year Strategic Plan for further elaboration.

  INCREASE OIL YIELD FROM EXISTING PLANTATIONS
  <p>
    Culminating from years of research by our palm biotechnology center using
    cutting edge tissue-culture cloning and genomic technology, we are beginning
    to see the results in higher oil extraction rate ("OER") achieved from our
    mills. For example, two of IOI's palm oil mills in Peninsular Malaysia have
    achieved average OER above 24% in FY2020. These OER are about 20% higher
    than the national average OER and have the potential to increase further as
    our mills process more of the younger-generation crop. From the perspective
    of the UN SDGs, the higher oil yields represent a more efficient and more
    sustainable yield as well as more efficient use of land which is in line
    with SDGs 2, 12 and 13.

    impacted governments, social institutions and businesses. At IOI, we believe
    that our sustainable and socially responsible practices as well as
    efficiently-run operations have enabled us to overcome the challenges in
    dealing with this crisis. With these challenges overcome, we can forge ahead
    with greater confidence to expand our green footprint and help to create a
    more climate friendly world.

  </p>
  <p>
    IOI Corporation Berhad ("IOI" or "the Group") is a leading global integrated
    and sustainable palm oil player listed on the Main Market of Bursa Malaysia
    Securities Berhad.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since venturing into the plantation business in 1983, IOI Group has
    consistently been ranked as one of the most efficient major plantation
    owners producing one of the highest oil yields in the industry. Employing
    more about 30,000 people in several countries, our vertically-integrated
    business model covers the entire palm oil value chain from upstream
    plantations to downstream resource-based manufacturing.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Group's upstream operations are operated by the IOI Plantation division
    which currently expands over 96 estates and 15 mills on more than 206,000
    hectares of land in Malaysia and Indonesia, making us one of the largest
    plantation owners in the industry. We practice a sustainable production and
    consumption cycle through investing in research and development to maximise
    our yield, driving mechanisation and innovation in our production line, and
    recycling our waste products. Through these collaborative efforts, we
    managed to produce a total fresh fruit bunch production of 3.1 million MT,
    which is lower than FY2019 mainly due to aggressive replanting and delayed
    effects of the long dry spells in 2018 and 2019. Our Business performance
    can be read in the Annual Report 2020.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Group's global resource-based manufacturing business comprises
    downstream activities such as refining of crude palm oil and palm kernel
    oil, and the processing of refined palm oil and palm kernel oil into
    oleochemical products. IOI has six manufacturing facilities in Malaysia and
    Germany with combined annual refining capacity of 1.8 million MT and
    oleochemical production capacity of 780,000 MT. The principal activities of
    the oleochemical sub-segment are the manufacturing and sales of fatty acids,
    glycerine, soap noodles and fatty esters. The oleochemical products are
    exported to more than 80 countries worldwide, mainly Japan, China, Europe
    and the United States ("US").

    wellbeing of our people is our utmost priority. We understand that having
    good safety and health measures in place can significantly reduce the risk
    of accidents, improve our employee's wellbeing, increase operational
    efficiency, reduce turnover and in turn, ensures our operations proceeds

  climate change
  <p>
    Climate change presents a range of potential risks to our businesses and
    activities. For example, extreme weather patterns can affect our planting
    activities, land arability and crops resulting in lower yields and
    productivity as well as further affecting our downstream activity and
    ultimately all our business operations. From stakeholder's perspective, our
    brand and reputation as a responsible and sustainable palm oil player can
    also be adversely affected if we do not involve ourselves in activities and
    projects that can help mitigate and adapt to climate change.

  Fire management
  <p>
    Fires pose major risk to our plantation operations as it can lead to damaged
    forest, plantable areas and conservation areas. The result can be decreased
    productivity and quality of crops, health hazards to our workers and
    community at large, loss of biodiversity &amp; habitat as well as releasing
    carbon especially from peat soils. Thus, it is imperative that a robust fire
    management is in place to mitigate such risk.
  </p>
  <p>
    IOI's Zero-Burning Policy and Fire Management Guidelines are enforced
    throughout our operations. Aside from mitigation measures within our
    operations, we recognise fire risk is a landscape-level issue to be handled
    together with other stakeholders. Thus, we work in partnerships and
    continuously engage our stakeholders including communities, government
    bodies, civil societies and industry association in our fire prevention
    efforts.

    Human resources are the backbone of our operations and providing a fair and
    decent wage is critical for talent attraction &amp; retention. Minimum wage,
    overtime pay, leave pay and well-organised record keeping reduce the risk of
    non-compliance with labour practices. IOI is committed to go beyond the
    national minimum wage by introducing productivity incentives wage payment.
  </p>
  <p>
    The rights of our workers are important to us, and IOI is committed to
    remunerate all workers according to or beyond the statutory monthly minimum
    wage as per the national labour regulations, which is also in line with our
    policy and guidelines.

  sustainability certifications
  <p>
    Our leadership position in the industry and exposure to international market
    means that it is crucial for our company to comply with local and
    internationally recognised standards through various sustainability
    certifications. This is also a form of 3 rd party verification of our
    compliance to acceptable internationally recognised standards. Having these
    certifications also encourage partnerships and collaborations among industry
    players to identify issues and innovative solutions, indirectly enhance
    productivity and enable us to be competitive in the global market.
  </p>
  <p>
    IOI has embedded economic, environmental, social, and governance principles
    from various certification schemes into the Group's SPOP and is progressing
    with the time-bound certification plans as published in the SIP. We also

    business operations. This is in line with IOI's revised vision to be a
    leading and sustainable business corporation with global presence and
    revised mission to achieve responsible and sustainable commercial success by
    addressing the interests of all our stakeholders, caring for the community

    Together with IOI's sustainability vision, we can ensure that all our
    business operations are done in a responsible and sustainable manners
    without compromising future generations.
  </p>
  <p>
    Even with our revised set of visions and commitments, our approach to
    sustainability is clear. Information and feedback from our stakeholders have
    to be solicited to understand which areas need to be improved and how IOI
    can continue to develop in a sustainable way. Next, goals and targets need
    to be set to ensure that operational optimisation can be achieved
    sustainably followed by the establishment of systems and processes to
    guarantee long-term value creation in our operations. Finally, the
    monitoring of our performance and revisiting the areas that may require
    further focus need to be done in order to continue to make meaningful
    progress and to meet current demands and challenges.
  </p>
  <p>
    IOI believes that the strong governance structure that have been put in
    place has enabled our organisation to effectively deliver our sustainability
    commitments and vision. This Sustainability Governance structure not only
    ensures transparency and clear accountability, it also makes certain
    sustainability sits at the top agenda of IOI's management. IOI's established
    Sustainability Governance structure can be seen in the figure below.
  </p>
  <p>
    In terms of assuring that the Group's sustainability agenda, commitments and
    issues are discussed, approved and implemented, the Group Sustainability
    Steering Committee ("SSC") was established. The SSC, chaired by the GMD,
    comprises of the heads of the operating divisions, Group Head of
    Sustainability and senior management from group support functions. The SSC
    which meets at least once a year, works directly with the Board.

    Day-to-day sustainability matter is led by IOI Group Head of Sustainability,
    who communicates and reports directly to the GMD to ensure that all of the
    Group's sustainability commitments, policies, guidelines, etc., are
    developed and implemented by the operations personnel. Sustainability
    functioning across the business operations are assisted by sustainability
    teams in each division to ensure sustainable practices are fully embedded
    within every operating units.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Group Head of Sustainability is supported and advised by the
    Sustainability Advisory Panel ("SAP") on important issues raised by key
    stakeholders. Moving forward, taking into account the key challenges raised
    by the SAP members as well as the changed circumstances that IOI now finds
    itself in, a proposal to evolve the SAP into a broader consultative forum is
    in the making. This forum would involve consultation with a more specific
    group of stakeholders including local and international civil society groups
    on topics where IOI is seeking very specific and targeted implementation
    advice and support.

  OUR SUSTAINABILITY APPROACH
  <p>
    Sustainability performance drives business success. IOI is committed to
    integrating sustainability into its core business and operations which
    reflected in the revised IOI vision and mission. Sustainability is not just
    the right thing to do, it is a critical driver of value for our business:
    IOI is committed to the sustainable management of its palm oil business and
    to the implementation of responsible, global palm oil supply chain. The
    Group's SPOP formed a foundation that outlines our sustainability
    commitments. The scope of the SPOP applies to all IOI operations worldwide,
    including our subsidiary companies, joint venture and companies in which we
    have management control.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Group's SPOP was revised during this reporting year to ensure that it
    stays relevant as a guiding principles and standardised with updated
    initiatives and sustainability strategy. The revision had taken into account
    the latest practices, internal policies, national and international
    initiatives implemented by IOI.
  </p>
  <p>
    In line with IOI's renewed vision to be a leading and sustainable Malaysian
    corporation with a global presence, our GMD has unveiled a Five-Year
    Strategic Plan for IOI. Sustainability is integral to this strategic
    blueprint More information on our strategic plan can be found in our Annual
    Report pages 38-43.
  </p>
  <p>
    The revised SPOP has been further expanded to include our firm commitments
    towards NDPE and the adoption of the relevant UN SDG as shown below:
  </p>
  <p>To comply with all applicable legislation and codes of practice</p>
  <p>
    To implement leading sustainability standards laid out in this policy for
    environmental management including NDPE, human rights and workplace
    conditions, community development and social impact Contribute to the UN
    SDGs in order to collectively achieve the 2030 Agenda of ensuring a
    sustainable future for all
  </p>
  <p>
    To build traceable supply chains such that all suppliers are also in
    compliance with our commitments as contained in our SPOP on environmental
    management, human rights and workplace as well as community development and
    social impact
  </p>
  <p>

  </p>
  <p>
    Guiding by the Group's SPOP, supporting guidelines and policies containing
    further details on our commitments and approaches on specific sustainability
    aspects were introduced and revised.

    Non-Governmental Organisation ("NGO") ("PONGO") Alliance, an alliance of oil
    palm growers, businesses and nongovernmental organisations who jointly
    advocate for and support the conservation of orangutans and other wildlife.
    The collaboration comes with the objective of establishing an ecological
    study on "Orangutan population at the estates adjacent to Kinabatangan
    river" in order to provide valuable data on the patterns of land use and
    critical habitat needs of orangutans in oil palm landscapes to facilitate
    co-existence within the oil palm landscape. From 16 to 19 December 2019, the
    Alliance visited participating IOI estates to gather information such as the
    geo-coordinates of the respective estates, identification of interest areas
    based on frequency of orangutan habitat sightings, tree species of the area,
    and the behaviour of orangutans inhabiting the area. The Group completed a

    Croklaan, Kerry Group and Fortuna Mill on the Initiatif Lestari Untuk Hasil
    Agrikultur Mampan ("ILHAM") programme for the second year. This project is
    in line with IOI's climate action strategy to maximise output from limited
    arable land by supporting smallholder farmers to improve their yields
    without the need for additional land.
  </p>
  <p>
    In December 2019, IOI finalised a fertiliser recommendation report which was
    shared with Fortuna Mill, for procuring sufficient biofertiliser for the
    smallholders and field application by February 2020. However, the process of
    biofertiliser distribution and application was delayed because of the MCO
    imposed by the government due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Activities will
    resume once the government lifts the necessary restrictions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Providing fair and decent living wage to the employees is one of the
    fundamental human rights obligations that IOI is committed to uphold by
    paying all employees statutory monthly minimum wage and overtime
    compensation, in accordance to the current labour regulations. The study
    that IOI has proactively participated since mid-2018 to promote such value,
    called the "Fair and Decent Living Wage Study" is one such initiative. This
    collaborative study, led and funded by Monash University, supported by the
    Ministry of Primary Industries with technical assistance from the
    International Labour Organisation ("ILO"), was completed in early 2020.
  </p>
  <p>
    The study charts the various labour practices used by the growers in
    Peninsular Malaysia, realistic estimation of livelihood requirements at
    different locations and initiatives by different companies to lift the
    living condition of workers.
  </p>
  <p>Among the notable outcomes from the study:</p>
  <p>
    Based on other living wage assessments in the most common countries of
    origin, it is clear that the wages earned in Malaysia (after average worker
    living expenses in Malaysia are subtracted) are in excess of the living wage
    standard of the country of origin.
  </p>
  <p>
    That while some foreign workers are made to pay high informal or subagent
    fees, the practice of `zero recruitment fee' and `word-of-mouth' recruitment
    (IOI adheres to both commitment and practices) in agent-dominated countries
    can prevent this sort of exploitation.
  </p>

    The completed report is now being shared with the RSPO and the Malaysian
    National Interpretation ("MYNI") Group for the purpose of benchmarking with
    their living wage framework.

  <p>
    Our approach to eco-efficiency is guided by our commitments as laid out in
    the Sustainable Palm Oil Policy ("SPOP") and we have, in part, achieved this
    by integrating the circular economy model into our operation. For example,
    during the production of our palm oil, biomass like EFB, kernel shells,
    etc., and wastes like POME are recovered, repurposed and reused within the
    operations. The practice of utilising usable materials as secondary raw
    materials and optimisation of raw materials along the supply chain as well
    as minimisation of wastage from production further help us achieve
    eco-efficiency in our operation.
  </p>
  <p>
    We also actively explore potential renewable energy initiatives to reduce
    dependency on non-renewable energy and at the same time improve our
    production efficiency to achieve higher production capacity with lesser
    resources. Such efforts are in line with our commitment to United Nation

  our Performance
  <p>
    Renewable Energy: Methane Capture Methane gas generated from anaerobic
    digestion of POME, one of the main sources of GHG emissions from plantation
    operation, can be much reduced by the installation of methane capture
    facility or methane avoidance facility for the mills. As of June 2020, IOI
    has 10 palm oil mills equipped with methane capture plant which generated
    more than 4.3 million m 3 of biogas, with another 2 plants are planned to be
    commissioned in second half of 2020.
  </p>
  <p>
    The methane gas captured from methane capture facility is being utilised as
    renewable fuel for boiler and for electricity generation through gas engine
    instead of conventional diesel engine. This practice allows oil palm mills
    to reduce fossil fuel usage and gain GHG credit from utilisation of
    electricity from renewable energy. Methane capture system is also being
    utilised at our IOI Oleo Wittenberge plant to produce methane gas out of
    waste water for the generation of steam, thus helping to reduce GHG
    emissions and costs on energy.
  </p>
  <p>Renewable Energy: Solar</p>
  <p>
    In 2019, as part of its solar energy initiative, IOI Oleochemical installed
    solar panels at its plant at Prai and was able to generate a solar power
    capacity of 83.49 kWp. The estimated solar energy yield per year from this
    project contributed to about 24.79% of the total power consumption of the
    main office, sports complex and cafeteria annually. Going forward, this
    project is to be expanded to other sites due to its effectiveness in energy
    saving.

    Solar thermal system under installation at IOI Pan-Cen for preheating boiler
    feed water As part of Malaysia Energy Efficiency and Solar Thermal
    Application Project ("MEESTA") which is supported by the Malaysian
    Government and implemented by United Nations Industrial Development
    Organisation ("UNIDO"), a new solar harvesting system is currently being
    installed at the IOI Pan-Century Oleochemicals ("IOI Pan-Cen") plant. The
    harvested heat will be used for preheating boiler feed water to substitute
    consumption of non-renewable energy usage. The plant is scheduled to be
    completed in late 2020. Alternative Energy: Liquefied Natural Gas System

    In July 2019, environmental-friendly LNG is used as gas in IOI Edible Oils
    ("IOIEO") Refineries' (Refinery 2 and Refinery 3) high pressure Geka boiler
    and will gradually replace the use of non-renewable diesel fuel for steam
    generation. This system has the potential to reduce as much as 20% of GHG
    emissions. Going forward, plans are in place to install this system at
    Refinery 1 after the successful utilisation in Refinery 2 and Refinery 3
    plants.

    Under No Deforestation, No Peat and No Exploitation ("NDPE"), IOI is fully
    committed to no new development on peatland and will adhere to the newly
    revised 2018 RSPO Principal &amp; Criteria. Where the management of peatland
    is concerned, all our 3,850 Ha of oil palm planted on peat is being managed
    in accordance to the RSPO Manual on Best Management Practices for Existing
    Cultivation on Peat as well as Management and Rehabilitation of Peatlands.
    There is a continuous rehabilitation programme in place and will take place
    in stages in accordance with our programme and schedule.

  Peatland Rehabilitation
  <p>
    Understanding the environmental and climate risks that poorly managed
    peatland poses, apart from observing best management practices, IOI also
    collaborates in rehabilitation projects with other stakeholders. Other than
    the on-going mini landscape level project whereby 10 Ha of degraded peatland
    of the forest reserve adjacent to Bukit Leelau Estate are being
    rehabilitated, we have also began to rehabilitate some of the peat areas
    outside of our concession in PT Kalimantan Prima Agro Mandiri ("KPAM") and
    PT Sukses Karya Sawit ("SKS") which caught fire due to the very dry season
    in 2019. During the reporting period, PT SNA had also rehabilitated the
    peatland adjacent to its HCV Management Area with 200 Rengas Manuk

    Internal Fire Monitoring and Emergency Response IOI, as the RSPO member
    committed to zero burning policy, strictly prohibits any burning activities
    within the company concessions. Most of the fire incidents we had on our
    concession were spread from outside of our concession. There were also some
    outbreaks inside the concessions which were due to natural causes, prolonged
    drought and possibly unintentional action by human. Within FY2020, there
    were a total of 17 fire incidences reported within and 52 reported outside

    The COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented global health threat which has
    rapidly affected all industries and organisations at different magnitudes.
    Although IOI is similarly faced with the sudden appearance of this pandemic,
    with no prior anticipation nor preparation for such crisis, we were able to
    quickly pivot to a new normal and effectively navigate the human and
    business impacts of the pandemic with minimal disruption to our work, supply
    chain, and business as a whole. More importantly, we were able to ensure our
    employees' health and safety are properly safeguarded against this unknown

  Response to covId-19
  <p>
    In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, IOI has actively provided awareness
    trainings to the employees since 7 March 2020. Throughout the MCO imposed by
    the Malaysian government, the safety and welfare of our employees and their
    families remained our utmost concern. IOI management has ensured that
    employees continue to receive their salary regardless of whether operations
    were suspended due to the MCO. Food security was also safeguarded by
    ensuring sufficient food supply at the groceries and food stores operating
    within the plantations.
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition, to prevent the spread of the virus within our operations, IOI
    had also introduced comprehensive guidelines and preventive measures. Such
    measures include face masks wearing, body temperature monitoring, physical
    distancing measures, contact-tracing, etc. COVID-19 emergency call posters
    were also posted in the various languages of our workers.

    We had also developed an SOP for any worker with a body temperature above
    37.5 ºC or displayed COVID-19 symptoms like cough, difficulty in breathing
    and headache. A standard quarantine period of two weeks under close
    observation would also be required for any worker who: So far, the
    procedures and preventive measures taken have been proven effective in
    curbing the spread of COVID-19 in IOI's operations as none of our workers
    have been tested positive for COVID-19. However, the management remains
    vigilant in observing good hygiene practices and adhering to the guidelines.
  </p>
  <p>
    Throughout the MCO period, large gatherings were prohibited. Face masks were
    distributed to each employee and we were required to sanitise our hands
    regularly. On top of that, our body temperatures were screened daily, and
    anyone with a body temperature above 37.5 ºC would be taken for treatment.

  IoI Face mask Initiative
  <p>
    Face masks are one of the most effective PPE against the transmission of
    COVID-19. Wearing face masks in public places was initially recommended by
    the government on a voluntary basis and subsequently mandatorily enforced by
    some of the countries where we operate. From the beginning, IOI has been
    providing free 3-ply surgical disposable face masks to our employees as part
    of our commitment to ensure the health and safety of the workforce are
    safeguarded during these challenging times. Distribution of the disposable
    surgical masks was subsequently replaced by reusable cloth masks that meet
    the N95 requirements, through the IOI Face Mask Initiative as long-term
    usage of replaceable surgical masks is not sustainable and could contribute
    to shortages of surgical masks in the market, especially for frontliners
    like those in the medical profession, security officers, etc.. Besides
    protecting our employees from COVID-19, we also extend similar support to
    our employees' dependents. Reusable face masks specially made for children
    will also be distributed to all school children within the plantations prior
    to re-opening of schools after long closure.
  </p>
  <p>
    As part of the community empowerment programme throughout this period, the
    management also initiated a community face mask project by encouraging the
    community within our plantations to sew their own reusable face masks.
    Materials needed for making the face masks were fully provided by IOI with
    the support from operating units in establishing their sewing facility
    complete with proper SOP to ensure that they are COVID-free. Non-working
    spouses of our employees are involved and their wages from making the face
    masks are being paid by IOI. The initiative comes with the objective of
    producing sufficient reusable masks for the plantation community while
    encouraging the community to generate alternative income during their
    involvement in making these masks.

  Plant Your own Food Initiative
  <p>
    Although our workers have been planting their own food, albeit in a
    haphazard manner, at the backyards of their house within the estate
    parameters, IOI started to formalise this activity in December 2019 via the
    "Plant Your Own Food Initiative". We did this by allocating specific areas
    for fruits and vegetables planting. Seedlings and fertilisers were provided
    to the employees interested in this initiative to ensure that this activity
    is done in a sustainable manner and in alignment with our UN SDGs.
  </p>
  <p>
    The management realised that the main benefit of this initiative is food
    security (UN SDG 2) for our plantation employees and this is especially
    during the COVID-19 pandemic when our workers had to be quarantined during
    the MCO. Furthermore, this initiative enabled the workers to have access to
    healthier fresh fruits and vegetables while minimising their expenses for
    food, reducing their carbon foot print and crucially, during the pandemic,
    reducing the risk of infection among our employees by decreasing their need
    to visit public places to purchase fruits and vegetables (UN SDG 8, 13 &amp;
    15).

    lemongrass, turmeric, galangal and many others.
  </p>
  <p>
    IOI further wanted to assess the value from the initiative by conducting
    detailed studies in Luangmanis Estate, Baturong 1 Estate and Kahang Estate
    which represented the Sandakan, Lahad Datu and Peninsular regions
    respectively. Currently, the total planted area for the estates in this
    study is 4,244 m 2 with the involvement from 260 households. In Indonesia,
    especially at PT SKS and PT BSS, most of the housing areas have been
    allocated their own areas to plant vegetables and rootstock plants for their
    own use. However, the official monitoring of the data for this initiative
    has not been conducted yet due to the pandemic.
  </p>
  <p>
    The management is currently in the process of identifying more areas for the
    workers to encourage more workers to be involved in this initiative as it
    has also contributed to enriching the lives of our employees by promoting
    tighter communal relationships among our employees and served as a
    beneficial leisure activity. This partnership between our management and
    workers reflects our commitment in contributing towards UN SDG 17.

  learnings from covId-19 Pandemic
  <p>
    Having good governance in place is crucial in ensuring appropriate actions
    are taken to handle a crisis. This is even more so during the COVID-19
    pandemic and IOI was able to demonstrate our good governance through our
    ability to operate more or less as usual. Such assurance was demonstrated
    during the MCO when we managed to assure our employees, suppliers, customers
    and investors that most of the operations are still able to operate through
    well-established guidelines and SOP, strong internal networking and updated
    information technology system. Employees were also assured of no salary or
    wage deduction throughout the entire period on top of the various assistance
    provided by the company to safeguard the livelihood of the employees.
  </p>
  <p>
    The crisis also reiterated the importance of an established, well executed
    safety and health system within our operations as shown in our ability to
    deliver the necessary awareness regarding COVID-19 to the employees, execute
    all the safety measures according to the newly developed guidelines and
    standard operating procedures provided by the government as well as the
    preventive measures required to prevent any potential infection within the
    operations.
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally, from the perspective of biodiversity and wildlife conservation, the
    COVID-19 pandemic, thought to be zoonotic in origin, has also highlighted
    the effect of human-wildlife interactions. Increasing threat to wildlife
    from poaching and illegal animal trade have been shown to increase the
    potential appearance of new diseases in the future. IOI takes this matter
    seriously through our commitments on biodiversity conservation and
    protection of Rare, Threatened, and Endangered ("RTE") species. A new
    guideline on biodiversity and conservation has been prepared to provide
    detailed guidance on managing and protecting wildlife within our operations.
  </p>
  <p>
    Because of the Plant Your Own Food Initiative, we can provide not only for
    the needs of our own households but also share our harvest with each other.
    One of the strategies is by the planting of high yielding clonal palms, with
    the highest clonal planting hectarage up to 54% and 34% in selected estate
    groups in Peninsular Malaysia and Sabah respectively. In addition to high
    yielding clonal palms, semiclonal palms derived from elite clonal Dura
    crossed with selected Pisifera ("DxP") for oil yield enhancement will also
    be planted. To date, planting of high yielding clonal palms contributes
    between 25 to 50% of planting materials in suitable locations in IOI's
    annual replanting programme. As an example of the success of our programme,
    IOI's Bukit Leelau Palm Oil Mill in May 2020, achieved an average Oil
    Extraction Rate ("OER") of 24.83%, the highest OER achievement in Peninsular
    Malaysia.
  </p>
  <p>
    Aside from breeding programmes, IOI is also focusing its research on oil
    palm genetic diversity studies, Deoxyribonucleic acid ("DNA")
    fingerprinting, Quantitative Trait Locus ("QTL") mapping and molecular
    markers development. An immediate goal is the development of IOI's Simple
    Sequence Repeat ("SSR") fingerprinting panel to be used as a quality control
    tool to produce DNA-authenticated DxP seeds, breeding materials and clones.
    This will help ensure only high purity DxP seeds, fidelity (true-to-type)
    clonal ramets and semi/bi-clonal seeds are produced from legitimate crosses
    and ortets in IOI.

  Field mechanisation in oil Palm
  <p>
    Mechanisation was introduced at IOI as part of the solution to improve
    productivity and reduce workers dependency on laborious tasks. For example,
    in December 2019, Main Line FFB Evacuation system was utilised at the Gomali
    Plantation complex where infield FFB collected at the collection platform
    was loaded using a grabber and then transported by tractor to the palm oil
    mill for processing. The FFB collection team was able to mechanically load
    30 to 40 MT of FFB a day to the mill compared to the conventional system
    that can only load 10 to 12 MT of FFB a day. Mechanical buffaloes and power
    wheelbarrows are also employed at difficult terrains to make the FFB
    evacuation process easier.
  </p>
  <p>
    Aside from elimination of laborious tasks, mechanisation provides
    opportunity to retain skilled workers through increased productivity and
    salary as shown in our pilot study on Main Line FFB Evacuation system at
    Gomali Estate which also showed a 50% reduction of labour usage.
  </p>

  drone thermal Imaging technology
  <p>
    Drone thermal imaging is the latest technology that is currently being used
    by our firefighting team to assist in early fire detection. The customised
    drone for heat monitoring is equipped with a 4K sensor for light capture and
    a FLIR Lepton thermal micro camera for thermal imaging. The system allows
    fire hotspot monitoring to be conducted at night, as well as in smoky or
    foggy condition. Multispectral dynamic imaging, incorporates high-quality
    light detail into thermal imagery in real time to enhance visual detail,
    allowing quick identification and interpretation of critical data that may
    not be immediately visible to the naked eye.
  </p>
  <p>
    Furthermore, the ability of this technology to display the average
    temperature of an object from far allows rapid monitoring to be done at
    locations which is not accessible readily, as for example due to safety
    issues. This technology is also particularly important for monitoring at
    peatland areas where fires sometimes occur underground with no real
    indication as there are no observable fires above ground.

  Product Innovation
  <p>
    While some European manufacturers are going towards the direction of palm
    oil free products in the mistaken believe that this will stop deforestation,
    IOI GmbH, with its ample supply of certified sustainable palm oil ("CSPO")
    from IOI's plantation operations, decided to advocate for producing products
    that contain sustainably sourced palm oil. They undertook this by converting
    the whole palm-based raw material portfolio into RSPO Mass Balance ("MB")
    certified palm oil to meet the growing demand of the personal care industry.
    In fact, both IOI's German manufacturing sites in Witten and Wittenberge
    committed to convert its entire production to sourcing 100% RSPO MB grade
    materials for its personal care products.
  </p>
  <p>
    Aside from supporting the uptake of CSPO, this commitment also increased the
    value of our products by meeting the strict requirements of COSMOS for
    organic and/or natural cosmetics.
  </p>
  <p>
    The combination of utilising CSPO and receiving approval by COSMOS have
    proven to be a great success to the sales of products where the sales volume
    increased by two-folds. This is a great example of how our commitment
    towards the 3Ps (People, Planet &amp; Prosperity) works hand in hand.

    Palm Olein) below 4 ppm to meet buyer's demand. Our workforce is the most
    important asset of our operations as activities such as seed production, oil
    palm planting and management, up to the extraction, refining and
    oleochemical manufacturing process, all require high degree of human
    intervention. With a strong workforce of about 30,000 worldwide, we are
    proud that we are able to contribute to society by providing jobs and
    opportunities to increase their standard of living. On top of this, IOI
    commits, based on our SPOP, to upholding the wellbeing of our employees by
    ensuring that our labour practices are aligned with
    internationally-recognised standards and to continuously implement best
    management practices that are in compliance with the requirements of human
    rights.

    IOI had published in 2017, the Foreign Workers Recruitment Guideline &amp;
    Procedure that we had developed with various stakeholders including NGOs.
    These guidelines provided a step-wise approach in ensuring every aspect of
    the recruitment process is being conducted accordingly. All job applicants
    have been given similar employment opportunities in IOI as per the Equal
    Opportunity Employment &amp; Freedom of Association Policy. However, due to
    the nature of work in the oil palm estates which is more physically
    demanding, most of our applicants are male. As a result, the breakdown of
    our workforce shows 70% of our employees are male. However, with the
    adoption of mechanisation in laborious field work, more female employees may
    be attracted to work in the estates in future.

  oUR PeRFoRmance system for monitoring of Human Rights and labour conditions
  <p>
    IOI was the earliest company in this industry to publicly commit not to
    charge foreign workers with recruitment-related fees. We had also placed
    KPIs on our estate managers stating that they must take proactive measures
    such as training to increase the workers' productivity with target earnings
    more than the minimum wage for each worker working during normal working
    hours.
  </p>
  <p>
    All these commitments have been well adopted across the operations since
    2017. In order to ensure continuous and consistent practices within the
    group, a comprehensive labour rights monitoring checklist was formulated and
    implemented at the plantations in Sabah and Peninsular Malaysia and further
    expanded to the Indonesia operations in November 2019. The Plantation
    Sustainability team continued to conduct internal audits on the monitoring
    of human rights and labour conditions based on the monitoring checklist.

  Workers' Retention in IoI
  <p>
    In recognising the importance of good labour and human rights practices in
    retaining workers in the plantation industry, IOI in collaboration with
    Earthworm Foundation has produced a video to showcase positive impacts of
    good labour and human rights practices to the industry. The video
    highlighted measures including adopting internationally recognised labour
    and human rights standards which has resulted in an increase in productivity
    and reduction in abscondment rate by almost 30%. Through various
    testimonials from migrant workers and our estate management, the video also
    illustrates how good labour and human rights practices can be part of
    effective labour retention strategies. The video has been publicly uploaded
    at Youtube 1 .
  </p>
  <p>
    Implementation of good labour and human rights practices is evident in IOI
    as the total workers increased from 23,749 as reported in our last report to
    23,809 in this reporting period.
  </p>
  <p>
    On 23 December 2019, IOI set another milestone with the signing of three
    collective agreements with the National Union of Plantation Workers ("NUPW")
    which came into effect from 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2022. These
    agreements will set the baseline of employees' wages and employment
    conditions on top of the benefits that IOI is providing to the workers,
    including but not limited to conducive working and living conditions,
    medical benefits, and education facilities for their children.

    further reduce the use of inorganic fertilisers. During replanting, old
    stems and fronds are made into mulch and applied on the field to maintain
    moisture and provide organic fertilisers. Where possible, we repurpose our
    organic waste such as empty fruit bunches ("EFB") and treated POME as
    fertiliser in our plantations.

  <p>
    The Group continuously explores waste management by "Reusing", "Recovering"
    and "Recycling" waste materials through integration of a circular economy
    model. Generated hazardous and non-hazardous wastes were handled based on
    environmental regulations. Non-hazardous waste is reused, recycled or
    disposed of at municipal landfills while hazardous waste is disposed by
    authorised collectors according to local regulations. Within the reporting
    period, IOI generated 5,110 MT of hazardous waste, and 330,664 MT of

  IoI oleochemical
  <p>
    Water sources for IOI Oleochemical are mainly from the municipal source
    while a minority comes from the rainwater harvesting systems. Efforts have
    been made to adopt eco-themed oleochemical processes such as the use of
    physical separation instead of chemical treatments to reduce the use of
    water. Rainwater harvesting systems were installed to take advantage of the
    abundant rainfall throughout the year for our Malaysian facilities in Prai,
    Penang and Pasir Gudang, Johor. The rain collected has been used to refill
    water for cooling and non-critical housekeeping purposes.
  </p>
  <p>
    While the existing Effluent Treatment Plant ("ETP") in Pasir Gudang site
    meets the Department of Environment's ("DOE") Standard B Discharge Limits
    quality, the treated effluent is mostly used for general cleaning purposes.
    In order for the treated effluent to be suitable for operational processes,
    a tertiary treatment system needs to be in place. As a result, a tertiary
    treatment system like the reverse Osmosis ("RO") treatment plant has been
    installed at the Pasir Gudang facility to treat wastewater effluent and
    reject water from the cogeneration plants to clean RO water for the cooling
    tower. This can lead to reduction of water withdrawal by 25% at the Pasir
    Gudang site. The Oleochemical plant in Prai has also embarked on water
    conservation projects such as recycling of the cogeneration plant RO reject
    water and recycling of effluent discharge.

    In IOI, good governance enables us to operate more efficiently, mitigate
    risks and safeguard our stakeholders' interests. We are more accountable and
    transparent to investors which improves our access capital. We achieve this
    state by committing to work with integrity and to uphold the highest
    standard of work ethics in line with our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics
    ("The Code").
  </p>
  <p>
    The Code provides guidance on the standards of behaviour expected of all
    employees of IOI Group, whereas the supplementary Code of Ethics for
    Directors is formulated for new on-boarding and existing directors. All new
    employees are communicated on The Code during their on-boarding training and
    The Code is available both in the employee's domain and at each operational
    unit.
  </p>
  <p>
    Where corruption is concerned, IOI solidifies our zero-tolerance approach
    towards corruption in any form by outlining them clearly in the Group's
    Business Ethics, Compliance, Anti-Corruption and Anti-Money Laundering
    Policy 1 . Topics covered in this policy includes our stance against
    kickbacks, gifts, hospitality and entertainment, protection money and
    political contribution.
  </p>
  <p>
    The policy which was published in 2018, is publicly available in our website
    and is communicated to all our employees through training/on-boarding
    sessions.

  Risk management
  <p>
    IOI maintains a platform for all stakeholders to provide their feedback and
    communicate their concerns over any of our operational impacts, areas that
    may require improvement or possibility of misalignment to our policy and
    best practices. Aside from the grievance procedure that has been described
    on page 34, IOI has an established whistleblowing approach to resolve both
    internal and external stakeholder concerns. Any case submitted through these
    channels will be processed transparently with the involvement of affected
    stakeholders. IOI also commits to safeguard all stakeholders involved in the
    grievance process against potential threats, intimidation, violence, or
    reprisals throughout the process.
  </p>
  <p>
    To effectively manage all of our sustainability and operational risks, the
    Group coordinates risks and audit oversight through the Enterprise Risk
    Management ("ERM") framework which is maintained by the Board-level Audit
    and Risk Management Committee ("ARMC"). The sustainability risks that
    concern our operations include human rights, local community grievances,
    occupational health and safety, fire management, deforestation, climate
    change, biodiversity, and peatland protection. These risks are managed at
    the business unit level and are guided by approved guidelines and SOP.
  </p>
</div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">
  Regulatory compliance
  <p>
    The Group ensures consistency in delivering our obligations through the
    adoption of best practices as outlined by the regulatory bodies and
    agencies. In addition, we engage with various stakeholders that includes
    government departments and agencies, to obtain insights and guidance, create
    ongoing dialogues, and to improve transparency and accountability. Such
    engagements and collaborations are in the form of technical workshops and
    roundtables covering topics such as peat, GHG emissions, labour, human
    rights, FPIC, traceability and certification requirements, training of staff
    on human-wildlife conflict, efforts on fire prevention and mitigation, and
    many more.
  </p>
  <p>
    For this reporting period, IOI continues to be actively involved in the MSPO
    certification standards improvement process by participating in the
    standards review working groups initiated by the Malaysian Palm Oil
    Certification Council ("MPOCC"). Involvement in the MSPO standards review
    process is important for IOI as it is a mandatory certification scheme by
    the Malaysian government.
  </p>
  <p>
    The review process involves strengthening the current requirements and
    ensuring that the requirements is on par with the industry standards. The
    review process started in September 2019 and is scheduled to be completed in
    2020.

  training on social Impact assessment
  <p>
    Recognising the importance of maintaining a good and cordial relationship
    with local communities, a training on Social Impact Assessment ("SIA") was
    conducted at PT SKS in July 2019 with the participation of all employees
    in-charge of community engagement. The training was conducted to equip the
    trainees with the knowledge to identify potential social issues and how to
    handle the potential social impacts arising from the company's operations.
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition, the participants were also trained on the principles of FPIC as
    a fundamental process especially pertaining to starting any development that
    may affect them or their surrounding by having them have their say to give
    or withhold consent to the development.

  training on business ethics, compliance, anti-corruption and anti-money
  laundering Policy
  <p>
    In September 2019, IOI revised this policy and provided awareness training
    on the updated policy to the Board of Directors and senior management team
    and subsequently to all the employees. The purpose of these trainings was to
    promote better awareness about corporate governance and to ensure employees
    understand the significance of the updated policy.
  </p>
  <p>
    The trainings was also to make sure that operating units will have the
    relevant process and procedures to prevent potential violation of the policy
    within or even outside of the organisation. The training also covered
    penalties and defences, adequate procedures, case studies, challenges as
    well as the steps that should be put in place internally to minimise the
    risk of corruption.
  </p>
  <p>
    There was no corruption case reported within IOI in the current reporting

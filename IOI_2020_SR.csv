As of June 2020, IOI has 10 palm oil mills equipped with methane capture plant which generated more than 4.3 million m 3 of biogas, with another 2 plants are planned to be commissioned in second half of 2020.The methane gas captured from methane capture facility is being utilised as renewable fuel for boiler and for electricity generation through gas engine instead of conventional diesel engine. This practice allows oil palm mills to reduce fossil fuel usage and gain GHG credit from utilisation of electricity from renewable energy.

This is even more so during the COVID-19 pandemic and IOI was able to demonstrate our good governance through our ability to operate more or less as usual.

Employees were also assured of no salary or wage deduction throughout the entire period on top of the various assistance provided by the company to safeguard the livelihood of the employees.The crisis also reiterated the importance of an established, well executed safety and health system within our operations as shown in our ability to deliver the necessary awareness regarding COVID-19 to the employees, execute all the safety measures according to the newly developed guidelines and standard operating procedures provided by the government as well as the preventive measures required to prevent any potential infection within the operations.Finally, from the perspective of biodiversity and wildlife conservation, the COVID-19 pandemic, thought to be zoonotic in origin, has also highlighted the effect of human-wildlife interactions.

In addition to high yielding clonal palms, semiclonal palms derived from elite clonal Dura crossed with selected Pisifera (""DxP"") for oil yield enhancement will also be planted. To date, planting of high yielding clonal palms contributes between 25 to 50% of planting materials in suitable locations in IOI's annual replanting programme.
